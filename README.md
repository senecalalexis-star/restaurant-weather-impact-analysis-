## Executive Summary
****The Challenge:** North Dinner, a seasonal restaurant, struggles with staffing efficiency during August rainy evenings.
**The Solution:** I built a custom Python ETL pipeline to analyze 2 years of transactional data against historical weather patterns
**The Insight:** Rain does **not** decrease total customer, I can actually increase it and it create a **"Floor Compression"** effect, increasing the traffic by 50% in interiror zones, creating service bottlenecks.

## Techinical Implementation
### 1.Data Engineering (Python ETL)
*Developed a Python ETL pipeline to extract, clean, and structure data from static PDF reports generated by the POS system.
*Validated data integrity against control totals before loading into **PostgreSQL**
**[View ETL Pipeline Documentation](code/)*

###2. The Findings 
**Key Insights: The Floor Compression Effect**
Rain don't affect restaurant volume and shifts customers from the patio (Zones 60-70-80) to the Interior (Zones 30-40-50), increasing table density by 50%.

##Recommendations
1.**Reallocate, Don't Cut:** Instead of cutting staff on rainy days, reallocate them insinde to handle the density spike.
2.**Smaller Party Rule** If possible priorise smaller party to create faster turnover.
